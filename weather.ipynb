The options (or flags) associated with `mkdir` are discussed in this blog by [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mkdir-command-in-linux-with-examples/). The `-p` (parent) flag creates the parent directory, which in this case is the `data` directory, if it is not already present. This command could be run a second time changing the subdirectory name to timestamps to complete the brief. However, to create multiple subdirectories inside a directory the following command from [howtogeek.com](https://www.howtogeek.com/275069/how-to-create-multiple-subdirectories-with-one-linux-command/) was used:\n",

    "The subdirectories are listed inside the curly braces and there must be no space between subdirectory names. This is a more efficient method of creating multiple subdirectories inside a parent directory. To confirm that the data directory and the subdirectories were created the `ls` was used. The `ls` command lists the visible files in the current working directory. To view all the files including the hidden files the command `ls -al` is used. To change to another directory the `cd` command is used. To view the files inside the `data` directory, the `cd` command was used to change into the `data` directory. The use of `ls` and `cd` is demonstrated in the image below.\n",

While researching the function and uses of backticks, I found this discussion on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/w3jqlz/do_you_prefer_backticks_or_parentheses_for/) that discusses the use of backticks. It seems that a newer syntax of `$()` should/could be used instead of backticks. `$()` can simplify the code and it avoides the [issues that the use of backticks can create](https://www.linux.org/threads/backtick-usage.47910/#:~:text=They're%20deprecated%20in%20the,older%2C%20pre%2Dexisting%20scripts).\n",
